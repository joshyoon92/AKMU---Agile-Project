**AKMU launches a new website to meet fans’ interactive needs and employers’ artist research**

The website gives various AKMU’s personal touch that gives fans more connections to the artist and have easy access for future musical employers.

Nov. 9, 2019 – AKMU today announced their own brand-new website that encompasses many features for their fans and future event organizers. 
Where the old website had only banal information about AKMU, this website has connection to AKMU’s social media, bi-weekly interview of upcoming event/album, 
online Live Concert, AKMU’s personal Vlogs, and monthly event of creating songs with their fans live. For show organizers, the website gives AKMU’s schedule, 
direct contact information for hire and updates on recent activities. The old website lacked connectivity from fans to the artist and lack of information for 
employers, and this new website has created contents that stirs up interaction and specific information.

“As an avid fan of AKMU, it always has been a frustration from the fan point of view of having the old website in the YG entertainment’s main website. 
The newly separated website has given me such more freedom to have a say as a fan in the comment section. The online live concerts are amazing, since I am not 
able to make all the concerts in person, and having to make a song with the artist was such an experience! I am not only a fan but can be a muse to the artist! 
The bi-weekly interviews are an improvement, since the newsfeed of their updates in text-form is always boring.”

Say good-bye to outdated ideas, and hello new contents. With this introduction of AKMU’s website, please enjoy the new features, connect with the artists, and 
send us other interactive ideas.
